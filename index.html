        <p class="lead mb-4">
    As a freshman at the University of California, Riverside, majoring in Neuroscience, my journey toward medicine and neuroscience began as a personal one, shaped by my own experiences with ADHD. This early challenge sparked a passion for understanding the brain and the mechanisms that influence both cognition and behavior. Iâ€™m driven by the goal of advancing patient care and supporting underserved populations, and my experience as a clinic intern has been pivotal in shaping this commitment. My mentors and colleagues have noted my professionalism, adaptability, and ability to follow complex protocols, qualities that I strive to build upon in all my work.
</p>

<p class="lead mb-4">
    In my role as a Clinic Intern at City of Hope, I have gained 150+ hours of hands-on clinical experience, supporting medical staff and interacting with patients directly. Working closely with medical teams to document patient progress, assist in exams, and deliver diagnostic tests, Iâ€™ve learned to prioritize patient comfort while maintaining the highest standards of safety and cleanliness. My role includes facilitating communication between nurses and doctors to ensure that critical information reaches decision-makers promptly, helping improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. My commitment to patient hospitality and comfort has deepened my understanding of the healthcare system and its social disparities, and I am dedicated to helping bridge these gaps.
</p>

<p class="lead mb-4">
    My professional journey also includes a summer internship at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Orange County, where I collaborated with the Scripps National Science Institute on AI research in cancer care. During this time, I spoke on a panel to discuss innovations in AI and its potential impact on healthcare, where I presented a project focused on applying AI in diagnostics. This experience allowed me to apply critical thinking and innovative approaches in a highly technical field, sharpening my interest in blending research with clinical practice.
</p>

<p class="lead mb-4">
    Beyond clinical settings, I have taken on leadership roles to improve patient experience and community involvement. I have volunteered with the High School Youth Action Team (HSYAT), where I managed fundraising events and collaborated with local administrators on initiatives to enhance youth engagement in community health. This role taught me the value of community service and the impact of accessible healthcare on individual lives.
</p>

<p class="lead mb-4">
    In high school, I founded the Healthverse Club, which centered around introducing students to health science, and served as an Advanced Choir Section Leader, a position that strengthened my communication and teamwork skills. As a Ted-ED Club Secretary, I developed organizational skills and supported public speaking initiatives, which has greatly benefited me in professional settings. Through coursework, internships, and extracurricular leadership, I have cultivated a well-rounded background that combines scientific knowledge with practical experience in patient care and healthcare advocacy.
</p>

<p class="lead mb-4">
    As I move forward, my goal is to contribute meaningfully to the field of neuroscience and medicine, combining my research interests with clinical applications. I am motivated to make a difference in patient care and contribute to advancements that could redefine medical treatment and accessibility for all.
